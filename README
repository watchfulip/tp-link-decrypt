1.  (optional)  Run ./preinstall.sh to satisfy dependencies

2.  Run ./extract_keys.sh  to extract RSA keys from TP-Link Firmware we download from vendor

3.  Run make

Decrypt with   bin/tp-link-decrypt <fw file>

This program uses libsecurity GPL code downloaded from https://static.tp-link.com/upload/gpl-code/2022/202211/20221130/c310v2_GPL.tar.bz2

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great care has been taken not to infringe TP-Link's rights.

RSA keys used for verification and decryption are taken from the firmware TP-Link themselves publish.

This tool does not allow signed firmware to be created.  Thus, there is no danger of unauthorized hostile firmware being placed on devices facilitated by this software.

It is hoped this tool may be useful in itself permitting seccurity researches to assist TP-Link with any vulnerabilties and also removing any unfounded suggestion of backdoors or hostile intent that may be levied at them.
